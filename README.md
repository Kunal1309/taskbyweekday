With the help of CSS, react JS and Material UI, I completed this task in last 24 Hrs.

Here, user can find UI as same as WeekDay Home Page where user can infinite scroll for jobs.

Due to lack of time left for me, I created job find inputs but didn't created functions for that. So the filter function not working right now !
